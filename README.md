**Abstract:** Sentiment analysis on social media platforms plays a crucial role in understanding public opinion and the decision-making process on political matters. As a significant number of individuals express their views on social media, analyzing these opinions is essential for monitoring political trends and assessing voter sentiment. However, sentiment analysis for low-resource languages, such as Tamil, presents considerable challenges due to the limited availability of annotated datasets and linguistic complexities. To address this gap, we utilize a novel dataset encompassing seven sentiment classes, offering a unique opportunity to explore sentiment variations in Tamil political discourse. In this study, we evaluate multiple pre-trained models from the Hugging Face library and experiment with various hyperparameter configurations to optimize model performance. Our findings aim to contribute to the development of more effective sentiment analysis tools tailored for low-resource languages, ultimately empowering Tamil-speaking communities by providing deeper insights into their political sentiments.
